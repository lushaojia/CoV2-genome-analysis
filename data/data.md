## Data 3
#
- **downloaded on:** 7/21/2021
- **downloaded from:** NCBI Virus
- **data description:** 
    1. genomic sequencing of SARS-CoV2 from all 50 States collected between 06/21/2021 and 07/21/2021, with samples from Iowa, North Dakota, and South Dakota as exceptions not collected in this timeframe. Each State has multiple samples that were collected in this timeframe. To determine which one is downloaded and used for analysis, a [random generator][4] was used. The first sample on the list is arbitrarily assigned with the index "1", and so on and so forth. Depending on the number of samples a State has, a number within this range is randomly generated, and data from the sample with the same index number is downloaded. For Iowa, North Dakota, and South Dakota, data from the latest sample collected is downloaded. All SARS-CoV2 genomes are complete with at most 50 ambiguous characters.  
    2. genomic sequencing of SARS-CoV2 of the sample collected from the earliest reported U.S. COVID-19 case in Seattle, Washington
